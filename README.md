# TFP_CORE
The TFP CORE modification for ArmA III is a pack containing music, patches and retextures used by the different groups I, Heartbroken, have been a part of during my time in ArmA 3. While not intended for download by anyone else but my current team French teams can get the modpack too for it contains some basic French looking retextures for Vanilla vehicles.

## Instructions
If downloaded from SyncWithSix the mod should work like any other ArmA III mod on Sync.
If downloaded directly from GitHub extract @TFP_CORE from its .zip file and copy-paste it in your root ArmA III directory. Then enable it either on the ArmA III launcher or directly ingame.
